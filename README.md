I decided to put the Ripple Prototype project to GitHub so that you can follow every code commit. I will try to package them in the simplest and most self-explanatory way I can so that you can learn as the project evolves. It will be UI-focused.

Make sure you read the tutorials:

[Animate in Xcode Without Code](https://medium.com/learning-xcode-as-a-designer/20c82a904164)

## Usage
This Xcode project uses [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).

<code>pod install</code>
